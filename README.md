# Lexicanter

Lexicanter is a lexicon management tool for constructed languages.It was developed and will occasionally be updated by Ethan Ray (known online as Cthethan or Saturnine).

I originally started working on this project because I like to keep my language's lexicons formatted nicely, at all times, yet need to keep them organized. Spreadsheets couldn't cut it for me because of aesthetics: keeping a spreadsheet pretty adds unjustifiable amounts of time to their maintenance. On the other hand, word processors lack the functionality for keeping a lexicon organized, and manually maintaining them quickly becomes unfeasible. So, I developed a tool that allows me to keep my lexicons presentable and organized, with the capability to export CSV for spreadsheets as well as plain text that can be brought straight into a word processor. Since then, the feature list of the tool has slowly begun to grow.
